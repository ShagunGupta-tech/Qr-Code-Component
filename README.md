## 🛠️ My Process

1. **Project Setup**  
   I started by creating the basic project structure with `index.html` and `style.css`. I also added a `preview.jpg` image for the README screenshot.

2. **HTML Structure**  
   I wrote semantic HTML to create the card layout, including an image, heading, and paragraph text inside a container.

3. **CSS Styling**  
   I applied base styles and used Flexbox to center the card both vertically and horizontally. I defined a limited container width and applied border-radius and box-shadow to match the design.

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**  
   I ensured the layout works well on small screens using a mobile-first approach. I tested on different screen sizes.

5. **Design Matching**  
   I carefully matched the font, colors, and spacing using the Frontend Mentor style guide. I also ensured the QR code image scales properly within the card.

6. **Final Touches**  
   I cleaned up the code, organized CSS for readability, and made sure the layout looked clean across devices. Then I took a screenshot and updated the README file.
